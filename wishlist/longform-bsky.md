# Wishlist: Long Form Article Display

Currently bsky posts are 300 graphemes long and support facets for @mentions and links.

This likely needs the design of an article / long form Lexicon type, and make it optional for bsky posts or attach it as a kind of embed.

an embed option would also lead to a pattern for display of other Lexicon types.

ideally the long form article Lexicon would be a Lexicon Community project rather than controlled as a bsky product Lexicon.

Bsky rich text is a kind of standoff markup that may be appropriate to base article on.
