# WikiJS Meta

Notes and discussion about this WikiJS application and this install in particular.

## Change Log

* March 30th. 2025: added the bsky post embed code to the header of all pages, see [Natalie's Login](https://wiki.atprotocol.community/en/login-with-atproto) for example.


## Installation

WikiJS https://js.wiki/

Details on this install will go here. Boris is admin.

### Git Storage

Storage scheme is git, and it uses a deploy key to push/pull from [ATProtocol-Community/atprotocolcommunitywiki](https://github.com/ATProtocol-Community/atprotocommunitywiki).

## Feature Wishlist

### Plugin for AT Protocol Login

Make a WikiJS plugin that can login with AT Protocol

### ATProto Comments

Comments that pull in bsky microblog replies from ATProto

### Figure out YouTube Players

Can turn on iframes and use embed code. Or, figure out a way to paste in links, and inject some header code that turns youtube links into embeds on the fly.
