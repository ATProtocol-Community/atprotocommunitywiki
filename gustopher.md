# Gustopher Goosetopher 

(image)

Gustopher Goosetopher is the full formal name of the mascot, which belongs to the AT Community Fund but can be re-purposed for other community events or working groups as needed.

"Gus" for short.

## Designed by Andy

With a very minimal design brief of "can you make us a mascot", [Andy](https://bsky.app/profile/andy.bsky.social) of [INTDEV](https://internet.dev/) created and named Gustopher for the first ATmosphereConf in Seattle in March 2025.

## Ambiguous Species and Gender

It was left as ambiguous whether this is a duck or a goose. The french duck faction lost out, so yes, it is a goose. It is not specified to be male, although is coded as such in fan fic. It is certainly not a Canadian goose -- Gustopher belongs to the world.

## Fan Fic

Organizers asked Ms. Boba if some fan fic art could be sourced with Gustopher and the Untitled Goose Game goose. The fans delivered!
