# Welcome to the AT Protocol Community Wiki

![@wiki logo](/assets/atwiki512.png)

This is a brand new community wiki. It is community hosted and moderated.

Please join the [Community Documentation Working Group](/working-groups/community-documentation/) if you're interested in getting involved more in wiki organization, translation, and other initiatives. Anyone is welcome to use this space for notes, how-tos, or other information related to AT Protocol or AT Protocol community.

## Updates

<!-- Is there a way of showing recently updated pages? -->
* The recent [ATmosphereConf Seattle 2025](/atmosphereconf/seattle2025/) has notes and transcripts here
* This is a fresh install of [WikiJS](/wikijs). That link contains some meta information about the setup here, as well wishlists for features like Login with ATProto
