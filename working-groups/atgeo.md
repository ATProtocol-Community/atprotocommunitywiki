# ATgeo

A collection of working groups and projects around lat/long, "geo information", named venues, and other location data.

The bulk of the WGs will be run through the [Lexicon Community](/lexicon-community), as well as supported and promoted by the [AT Protocol Community Fund](/atproto-community-fund).

Resources
* Dev Discord [#lcwg-atgeo-gazetteer](https://discord.com/channels/1097580399187738645/1354817305594302647)
* [ATgeo Gazetteer WG](https://github.com/lexicon-community/wg-atgeo-gazetteer)

# Location Data on ATProto

Location Data on ATProto, which has now come to be known as "ATgeo", is a funded project stewarded by the AT Protocol Community Fund. Read the [announcement blog post](https://atprotocol.dev/location-data-on-at-protocol-the-second-community-fund-project/) for background.

The four main deliverables include:

1) Default venue and geo lexicons
2) Foursquare OS Places integration:
3) A venue lookup end point and widget that apps can use
4) Backend firehose, feeds, and search support, with a default map visualization

The Community Fund will fund contributors, as well as support developers in integrating the venue/geo lexicons.

Backend, commons infrastructure servers will be run for at least a year to start.

# Intent to Implement

> If you are a developer intending to / wanting support to implement the ATgeo lexicons, please list your bsky handle, your app name, and a source code git link or other relevant links.
