# IndieSky

What does it mean to run independent AT Protocol / Bluesky network infrastructure? Working together to host commons infrastructure, and build better tooling for our needs.

The name of the working group comes out of the [group discussion at ATmosphereConf Seattle](/atmosphereconf/seattle2025/indiesky).

There is some funding available through the AT Protocol Community Fund being run through a [dedicated project on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/atprotocoldev/projects/indiesky).

# Upcoming Meetings

## IndieSky WG002: PDS Hosting

May 22nd, 9am PST / 12pm EST / 1800 CEST

From our last meeting, we did a speed run through the entire architecture. It felt like PDS hosting would show immediate data sovereignty, but there were very few people who had open or paid signups.

* PDS for Jurisdictions: running a PDS in a particular country or jurisdiction
* PDS for Communities of Interest: Academic / university affiliated hosted was a special case
* PDS for App Devs: running a PDS along with a custom app to provide smooth sign up

We'll call for questions and notes ahead of time, likely using Laurens questions from Ahoy IndieSky as a basis.


## IndieSky WG001: Virtual Kick Off Meeting

May 8th, 9am PST / 12pm EST / 1800 CEST

* Introductions
* Overview of IndieSky goals around independent ATProto infrastructure
* Recap of IndieSky day at Ahoy
* Identify shared needs and areas of interest, and highlight communication & documentation channels
