# IndieSky

What does it mean to run independent AT Protocol / Bluesky network infrastructure?

The name of the working group comes out of the [group discussion at ATmosphereConf Seattle](/atmosphereconf/seattle2025/indiesky).

There is some funding available through the AT Protocol Community Fund being run through a [dedicated project on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/atprotocoldev/projects/indiesky).

# Definitions & Components

## PDS

There are 1000s of independent PDS instances (see [Mackuba's Directory](https://blue.mackuba.eu/directory/pdses)), but there are very few things tied to PDS at this point that make impact on users. A PDS provides authentication and user data storage.

The jurisdiction where a PDS is hosted is of most interest. Hosting providers for large amounts of user accounts and their data could provide data sovereignty.

## Relay

Either firehose (higher computation required, fully verified data) or jetstream (optimized for speed and lower performance, but not fully verified). These days, getting simpler, cheaper, and faster to host.

Non-archiving relays are the norm, with a 36-72 hour window of all the data from all AT Protocol accounts being available.

Can provide API end points for independent developers.

Archiving / aggregation of data is likely most relevant for specific appviews.

## AppView

TBD

## Moderation

Jurisdictional or mission aligned moderation, and the possibility to not have Bluesky Default Moderation, would be the features provided.

## Feeds

Default feeds (e.g. Bluesky Discover) are another feature for IndieSky products.

For example, the [Your PDS](https://bsky.app/profile/essem.space/feed/your-pds) feed shows posts from just the people on your PDS. One can imagine a Canada or Europe hosted PDS, then also promoted a branded PDS feed with others who are hosted in the same jurisdiction (likely paired with default moderation or other groupings).


# Organizations & Initiatives

Organizations and initiatives interested in implementing, supporting, running infrastructure, and developing solutions around IndieSky.

*Please add yourself*

* [NorthSky](https://northskysocial.com/) -  group of passionate web developers and community moderators working to build a digital space designed around active moderation and user safety for 2SLGBTQIA+ communities. Will be running servers in Canada.
* [Free Our Feeds](https://freeourfeeds.com/) - would like to see infrastructure independent of the Bluesky company
* MapleSky - Canadian sovereign infrastructure (Blaine, Boris, in formation)
* EuropeSky

# Meetings

## IndieSky Europe April 25th, 2025 (Ahoy)

The day after the main [Ahoy](https://ahoy.eu) conference. Discussions and definitions of what can be run and what the goals are. Primarily technical, but also discussion of how to explain to users, politicians, etc what they should care about.
