# IndieSky

What does it mean to run independent AT Protocol / Bluesky network infrastructure? Working together to host commons infrastructure, and build better tooling for our needs.

The name of the working group comes out of the [group discussion at ATmosphereConf Seattle](/atmosphereconf/seattle2025/indiesky).

There is some funding available through the AT Protocol Community Fund being run through a [dedicated project on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/atprotocoldev/projects/indiesky).
