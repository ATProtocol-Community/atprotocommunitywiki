## AT Protocol Specification

![atprotocol.svg](/assets/atprotocol.svg)

This is not full documentation of the AT Protocol, nor is it the home of the specification.

The specification currently maintained by Bluesky in their company repo at [bluesky-social/atproto-website](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto-website) and published at [atproto.com](https://atproto.com/). It is licensed CC-BY.

Feedback and contributions to the specification are welcome!
