# Overview

The Private Data Working Group is focused on private lexicon records stored in PDS, and sending them between other PDS securely.

Right now, encryption at rest is not a goal. This is more like a "classic app" - access control is applied by the PDS, and sent securely to devices or other PDS instances.

An adjacent space is groups / audiences / private accounts. If people don't want their content seen at all, then it can't be part of their public repo, and can't hit the relay. This may be a major part of private data, with a focus on social use cases, rather than "app" use cases -- e.g. a private blog post, article, recipe, event, etc.

> Note: the Bluesky team **is** working on this, and the point is to learn together, with active experimentation and running code.

The [E2EE Working Group](/working-groups/e2ee) is covering DMs / group chats, which might embed or share certain lexicon types (e.g. images, bsky microblog posts, profiles), but is a different set of use cases, and is focused on encryption.
