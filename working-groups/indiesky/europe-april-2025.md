# IndieSky Europe

* Friday, April 25th, 2025
* Register for [Ahoy](https://ahoy.eu) -> you can also [sign up to Luma](https://lu.ma/398odzkj) for updates

One day working session on discussing independent AT Protocol infrastructure for Europe. Day after the main [Ahoy](https://ahoy.eu) day in Hamburg, Germany.

IndieSky is short hand for running independent architecture that approximates the Bluesky network / AT Protocol components. More info on the [IndieSky Working Group Page](../indiesky).

## Theme
How do we run/why do we run ATproto infrastructure regionally and as a commons.

## Intros

- IndieSky in Canada
- worker-owned co-operative
- rolling out PDS
- data security for trans and other adverse affected groups
- all data is at rest, having it in Canada less Google takedown
- Graphical PDS migration - tool in rust
- frontend Cloudflare worker, backend in rust ü¶Ä - backend can run locally standalone app

    - crazy stuff may happen anywhere soon
    - science needs 'resilient global infrastructure'
    - Does that include a DEDICATED RELAY for the scientific community?
- Lexicon Archives seem useful too?

- Goal was to make sure there was an ATProto community, not a bluesky community.
- Work towards making the community sustainable.
- Don't think the single foundation model is a good idea (pew pew!)
    - Commercial companies, non-profits who can come together to work on things, IETF style, running code in rough consensus, and things like working groups are the baby steps of coming together.
- Been building open social communities for the past 20 years.
- We have a chance to move past the toxic digital communications era, and we can get to the aqueducts and sewers stage.

## Core ATP Stack

- note: not all layers needed for any given use-case, so not exactly a "stack"!

|layer|incentives|costs|supports|*definition of independence*|examples|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|appview||||||
|firehose (optional?)||||||
|historical archive|||||redsolver.dev|
|labeler||||||
|relay (lexicon-specific)||||||
|relay (general-purpose)||||||
|PDS||||||
|moderation svc||||||
|PLC dir||||cannot be run out of resources?||

## Orthogonal Infra

- extensions and alternate stack components

|layer|incentives|costs|supports|*definition of independence*|examples|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|app stores/aggregators||||||
|e2ee infra||||||
|private data???||||||
|localfirst/offline PDS client||||||

## Layering exercise

- 3 inspirations
    - content-identifiers
    - ???
    - microservices architecture

- Rotationa nd revocation events have a 24 hour statute of limitations events
- PLC directory is owned by BSky right now.

https://pdsls.dev/at://did:plc:l5yz32nydpebjlcdfgycmf3x

walk through of PLC Directory
https://web.plc.directory

write only log

You can create an account on your own PDS through the Bluesky app -> screen


"a blockchain is a very expensive transparency log"

https://boat.kelinci.net/plc-oplogs?q=knowtheory.net

You can't currently move back onto a Bluesky PDS once you've migrated off
- boris: this is due to a technical error - allowing this would crash lots of PDSs [LINK?]
    - bf: well there may be a good technical reason FOR the policy, but it is still a policy, which could stay in place if the reason were fixed; it's a business decision of each PDS host, no technical or contractual obligation to accept inbound migrations

Mirror the PLC Directory is happening

# Northsky
- Data sovereignty for marginalized communities
- Concern about Turkey like situation, where a gov w/ jurisdiction over BSky would add a labeler to hide content.
- Canadian company, Canadian data hosting.
- Even if all of your users are on Bluesky data is in Canada
- If there were a default gov labeler, US gov could say hide all Northsky data from US users.
- Considering the Blacksky example with community moderation.
- Initial use case is on resilience w/r/t data
- Discussion about what labelers are and where label data lives.
- community not the same as infrastructure



# moderation and trust and safety

- very expensive
- "no moderation without remuneration" -- haha wish

# PDS Implementations

https://wiki.atprotocol.community/en/wiki/reference/community/implementations/pds-implementations

# Common ATProto Relay for Europe (CARE)

## Relay

Scanning at relay layer for things -> details on scanning plugin + Ozone integration

## PDS Hosting

This is a separate call to action
European owned companies and european jurisdiction data centres

FoF -> has been talking to cloud providers in Europe

Upcloud would be interested

Limit of 200 on new PDS

What is my responsibility? -> university hosting would want community moderation.

German hacker spaces each having local hosting

### Questions that a PDS Hosting Working Group needs to answer
* What is the business model (for-profit, coop, something else)
* What software is used for the PDS (rsky, bsky one, something else)
* what software is used for the moderation (ozone, build something for yourself)
* How is infra content moderation handled (hive, roost, something else)
* What does legal responsibility within the organisation look like
* What type of organisation would it be
* Jurisdiction (EU? Where in EU? Canada?)
* How to get funding
* Would this be a separate organisation from an org that runs a relay/appview/whatever
* How to deal with moderation for lexicons that Ozone does not handle (someone using ATFile to upload the bee movie)
* Structure for getting DMCA requests
* How to get started with such a working group 
    * What kind of commitment are we asking for people/orgs that would want to be part of this
* How to handle the actual hosting
* Considerations for collaboration with other orgs like Blacksky and Northsky
* What would be the salespitch for funding
* Who makes the guideline on how to deal with (political) takedown demands from governments
* What kind of (if any) collaboration with Bluesky PBC


#### Getting started with PDS Hosting Working Group
* Getting small core group committed who wants to get such a group off the ground
* Core group gets rough agreement on which questions they are going to answer

### Ozone Needed

What is the take down process?
* service level moderation
* Ozone instance also needed
    * hide accounts
    * take down
    * remove posts
* NorthSky is Seriously looking at rsky - backup and restore / cloud hosting
* automod -> puts in the queue for Ozoned


### Business Model

Maybe PDS can be a profit center?

* Community PDS?
* SpaceHost $12/for one account

## Call for action

Who is running a PDS and wants to have their data pushed to the CARE?
* update your PDS_ENV
* NorthSky would do this

* University Collaboration
    * sovereign infrastructure - any dean in the western world says yes
    * solidarity between universities
    * two use cases - European PDS & relay
    * All the other stuff can come later?

## AppView

Headless Appview
- Constellation instance -- does this give us API endpoints for hydration? From there, build apps on top?
- API end points for aggregated queries
- historical search

## Archive

- Distributed backups
- Search over older content
- Free access to information


## Open Questions / Follow Ups

* Can Bluesky PBC share the PDS ban list?
    * maybe approval process for limits
* Roost Tools for moderations
* Ozone instance managing multiple PDS instances?
* Friendly list of Euro cloud hosts
* Jurisdiction - "someone" to take policy questions
* Non-bluesky lexicon moderation

What kind of entity?
* can we start with a hosted collective? e.g OpenCollective Europe
* Boris, Dietrich can help with this
