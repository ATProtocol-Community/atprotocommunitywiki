# IndieSky Europe

* Friday, April 25th, 2025
* Register for [Ahoy](https://ahoy.eu)

One day working session on discussing independent AT Protocol infrastructure for Europe. Day after the main [Ahoy](https://ahoy.eu) day in Hamburg, Germany.

IndieSky is short hand for running independent architecture that approximates the Bluesky network / AT Protocol components.

# Topics

Please add topics / concerns / questions or anything you'd like to discuss live.

We'll start with an overview session to detail the architecture as we understand it, and what does need to be run independentely / co-operatively or otherwise.

## EuroSky

Independent infrastructure for Europe.

## Business Models & Funding Paths

From co-operatives, to commons infrastructure, to small business software builders, to venture scale startups, what are the paths to funding and business models?
