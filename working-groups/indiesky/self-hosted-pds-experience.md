# Self Hosted PDS Experience

What is the experience of being on a non Bluesky PDS?

If you have your user account on a Personal Data Server (PDS) that isn't run by Bluesky, what is different?

For starters, the experience of using the Bluesky website or mobile apps isnt any different. Instead of signing into Bluesky, you authenticate with the server you're hosting on, and any posts you make or images or video you uplaod are stored on your PDS.

## Bluesky PDS Outages

There have been several instancss when the Bluesky PDS servers have been down.

The Bluesky web and mobile instances stayed up (as well as relay and moderation services), so independent accounts could login and post as normal.

The only effect was seeing only posts from other independent PDS users, so posting volume was very light.

This [ATmosphere Dwellers feed](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ca4b3evcz7rjhni6mngjwfzl/feed/non-bsky-pds) lists posts from users on non-Bluesky servers, so this is the content users would see.
