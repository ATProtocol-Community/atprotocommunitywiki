## Interests

*Pasted in from Luma registration with slight anonymizing. Feel free to claim publicly, add links*

* as part of a vulnerable community, I feel the need to learn more about safe infrastructure and about European tech autonomy. From the product/community side, I am mainly interested in building tools for musicians and (independent) music business.
* EuroSky
* I am interested in running a POC of Community Notes on ATProto. There are many benefits of using independent ATProto architecture, from running PDSs, and indexing to dids. For both projects, e.g Community Notes requires anonymity, and thus, a different PDS architecture, as well as indexing.
* Having services that aren‚Äôt tethered to US providers
* Supporting Freeing Our Feeds
* especially interested in anything that helps create greater independence from the Bluesky PBC, for our own project and for the atproto ecosystem as a whole; and specifically, at the moment, we are quite interested in potentially being able to offer independent PDS hosting for our community members.
* academic and researcher focused infrastructure
* Insight into things that are assumed in the bluesky world but may be different if running a separate network (e.g. centralized DIDs and their pros and cons and relationship with privacy)
* data sovereignty
* things like hosting a PDS for our community of scientists would be hugely interesting to us. Having an alt relay to hook in to would also be amazing for us to demonstrate to the wider astronomy community that our platform won't go the way of Twitter someday, and that it can be trusted. ([emily.space](https://bsky.app/profile/emily.space))
* I'm intrigued by AppViewLite and Deer and thinking about how we might leverage them in our next round of infra development (_I think this was me - √Ü._)
* Replicating an IPFS pin set across geographically distributed, volunteer-run PDSs
* I work with ActivityPub in museums. I am interested on Fediverse connections.
*  It is my intention to set up a PDS for beyond that of personal use.
*  Able to run couple of PDS. Still looking to setup a relay. More to learn.
*  I might query my PDS for my personal website!
* Communicate opportunities to policymakers. Help build collective intelligence.
* Break Big Tech monopolies
* Interested in how independent publishers and media organizations can have more control over distribution and relationships with fans.
* Im just interested in at protocol dev and want to learn more!
* Hyperlocal digital sovereignty
* Trying to build a fully featured independent AppView, and host an independent Relay.
*  the expectations of lexicon interoperability with existing lexicon.
*  Link attestation of educational skills to a social graph 
* academic institution hosting 
* atproto data storage for "composable" OER
* long-form scientific writing with DOI
* Working on entirely independent bluesky-based social networks, not aiming at federation with the general network, for specific domains (Strava for other domains)

### Interest in running PDS for others
* @icyphox.sh
* @danoleary.me
* @aendra.com
* @erikologic.bsky.social
* @hilk.eu (not sure yet)
* @emily.space

	Yes! -> https://atproto.wiki as a space, and starting with everything from how to explain to mass market ‚Äî> explain to community leads what you can do with different components
	
09:15:01 From Ted Han to Everyone:
	Replying to "Does anyone need/want volunteers for the edu compo...":
	Heck yeah!  Definitely a conversation we‚Äôd love to break out too.
	Rachel-Lee Nabors:‚ù§Ô∏è

	Replying to "Sewers and water!":
	It‚Äôs complicated stuff!
	
09:17:52 From Robin Berjon to Everyone:
	It should be spelt IndySky.

	We ü•∞ relays.
	phil, Ian Brown:‚ù§Ô∏è
	
09:18:10 From Wesley Finck to Everyone:
	Love the shift in framing for governments to support an ecosystem of infrastructure that people can then build sovereign social networks on top of (rather than them trying to build their own social network)
	Emily Hunt:üëç
	eduardo, Ian Brown:ü•∞
	
09:18:24 From Alice to Everyone:
	i run a couple relays in the winter to keep the house warm

	eduardo:ü•∞
	
09:18:45 From Ted Han to Everyone:
	Ahoy.eu was in Hamburg at the end of April
	
09:19:16 From Ian Brown to Everyone:
	absolutely you need both
	
09:19:32 From Robin Berjon to Everyone:
	considering starting a podcast called Oh Relay?
	Alice, phil:üî•
	Enrico, Shakirov Marat, Ian Brown:üòÇ
	Ted Han:üòÜ
	
09:19:43 From Roscoe Rubin-Rottenberg to Everyone:
	I think the draw for governments will be that they can self host so it‚Äôs perfect for official comms channels
	Ian Brown:üëå
	
09:21:00 From Ian Brown to Everyone:
	Replying to "I think the draw for governments will be that they...":
	Essential for eg emergency comms
	
09:21:23 From Wesley Finck to Everyone:
	lots of question marks around lexicons for api endpoints (xrpc methods) and pds events - how do you actually implement those and how can you build a relay on top of that?
	
09:21:37 From Emily Hunt to Everyone:
	Replying to "I think the draw for governments will be that they...":
	This! It would be really cool if someday the framework was so easy to do this that governments could set this up without needing much knowledge of the wider infra
	
09:22:19 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	Replying to "lots of question marks around lexicons for api end...":
	Alternate data lexicons are automatically transmitted across the relay right now
	
09:22:40 From Robin Berjon to Everyone:
	Replying to "I think the draw for governments will be that they...":
	We‚Äôre not that far from it. I actually had a conversation with institutional folks in Japan in March about verified emergency comms using AT.
	
09:23:01 From Enrico to Everyone:
	Replying to "lots of question marks around lexicons for api end...":
	IDK if it can help but this is one event consumed right at the relay firehose:
	```
	{
	  action: 'create',
	  path: 'app.bsky.feed.like/3looczth7oc2e',
	  cid: 'bafyreich3ih7yhopxsios4iaujhrb6gez3o6uitstluml3cxbyrflnhknq',
	  record: {
	    '$type': 'app.bsky.feed.like',
	    subject: {
	      cid: 'bafyreigpas5h6y2347q6w5mf32hd2nyebo7pz24dyxcf4ygveupii5mtte',
	      uri: 'at://did:plc:k2weqoffrljoi7d45jjhjaqk/app.bsky.feed.post/3loo4uyximc2f'
	    },
	    createdAt: '2025-05-08T16:21:56.395Z'
	  }
	}
	```
	
09:23:29 From Bailey Townsend to Everyone:
	Replying to "lots of question marks around lexicons for api end...":
	For the creating api endpoints, I noticed yesterday in the atproto repo the lex-cli has a gen-server command. Have not tried it yet https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/lex-cli
	
09:24:20 From Rachel-Lee Nabors to Everyone:
	I love how the distributed nature thwarts coordinated attacks like that
	
09:24:26 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	PLC is totally centralized! We should all admit this! The plan of record @Bryan Newbold (Bluesky) is spinning this out into a separate entity ‚Äî and is high priority as part of the discussion with governments.
	
09:24:40 From Robin Berjon to Everyone:
	Replying to "PLC is totally centralized! We should all admit th...":
	Yesssss
	
09:25:11 From Dan O'Leary to Everyone:
	Can you share a link to that model you're showing now?

	Replying to "https://www.figma.com/board/y7Q3uHzeWcTHTlVpXWhXK5...":
	Not Enough Relays
	
09:26:00 From Wesley Finck to Everyone:
	Replying to "lots of question marks around lexicons for api end...":
	Oh cool that gen-server seems relevant‚Ä¶
	
09:26:59 From Nick Gerakines (he/him) to Everyone:
	"something like that" is legit
	Dan O'Leary, James Walker (@walkah), phil, Bailey Townsend, Anirudh:‚ù§Ô∏è
	
09:27:40 From Enrico to Everyone:
	Sorry, all the other arch diagrams show the PDS as the only client entrypoint. Are we suggesting that the clients can consume directly from AppViews? Or will the PDS still act as a proxy?
	
09:28:08 From Wesley Finck to Everyone:
	Replying to "lots of question marks around lexicons for api end...":
	Ya im mostly thinking about if someone wants to implement custom queries, procedures, and subscriptions (all primary lexicon types) it seems they will need to implement their own pds which provides those endpoints and emits those events. I don‚Äôt think there is a way to extend the bsky provided PDS in this way?
	
09:28:47 From Anirudh to Everyone:
	probably helps to mention that the client writes to the PDS
	
09:29:20 From Robin Berjon to Everyone:
	Replying to "lots of question marks around lexicons for api end...":
	You can have your own API endpoint for XRPC (though you don‚Äôt have to use XRPC), and that endpoint will write records, blobs, etc. to the PDS.
	
09:30:07 From Robin Berjon to Everyone:
	Can‚Äôt wait for UCANs!

09:31:02 From Bailey Townsend to Everyone:
	Replying to "lots of question marks around lexicons for api end...":
	I may be thinking of it wrong. But this is where custom AppViews come in and what I consider them when I talk about them. PDS is source of truth, AppView caches the data and gives you ways to show it. Kind of like the Statusphere where yous have the emojis in the db and then it has an endpoint to show those it picked up from the firehose
	
09:31:40 From Wesley Finck to Everyone:
	Replying to "lots of question marks around lexicons for api end...":
	Hmm, so what‚Äôs the point of using lexicons to define endpoints and event types if everyone is just using the ones provided by bsky https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/lexicons/com/atproto/repo
	
09:31:58 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	I think ‚ÄúLogin with ATProto‚Äù is something we could work on with education / design / messaging
	Bailey Townsend, Laurens Hof:üíØ
	
09:32:19 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	And then PDS, in some ways, very directly gives data sovereignty ‚Äî which is explainable
	
09:32:29 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	‚ÄúDo you want your data hosted in Canada?‚Äù -> yes!
	Ian Brown, Emily Hunt:üòç
	
09:32:39 From Enrico to Everyone:
	To clarify, my POV is from somebody that would be interested in hosting a full independent clone of BSky so I need to make some considerations in terms of performances and such
	
09:32:39 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	(Without over focusing on the word PDS)
	
09:32:56 From Shakirov Marat to Everyone:
	Replying to "I think ‚ÄúLogin with ATProto‚Äù is something we could...":
	then it should be standrtized as FIDO or be part of it
	
09:33:24 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	Replying to "To clarify, my POV is from somebody that would be ...":
	Performance is mostly from reads. You‚Äôre not going to hit lots of reads without lots of work. See deer.social
	David Fraser:üëçüèº
	
09:33:26 From Roscoe Rubin-Rottenberg to Everyone:
	Rough model of explaining the protocol to non-technical users:

	Anirudh:‚ù§Ô∏è
	
09:33:28 From Shahar Refael Oriel to Everyone:
	Where are the DIDs in this diagram?
	
09:33:45 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	Replying to "Where are the DIDs in this diagram?":
	PLC identifiers
	
09:34:37 From Robin Berjon to Everyone:
	Bluesky can monetise their microblogging service while the AT protocol thrives.
	Ian Brown:üëå
	
09:34:43 From Wesley Finck to Everyone:
	Maybe a more accessible analogy: PDS = kind of like a google drive, you have folders and files, but you technically could move it around to dropbox or other providers
	Ian Brown:üëå
	
09:34:44 From Chris Boscolo to Everyone:
	Replying to "Where are the DIDs in this diagram?":
	And technically also did:web
	
09:34:57 From Robin Berjon to Everyone:

	And it‚Äôs also your browser.
	
09:35:29 From Enrico to Everyone:
	Replying to "To clarify, my POV is from somebody that would be ...":
	Ok so the answer is ‚Äúit‚Äôs app depending‚Äù? 
	Atproto allows us to develop an app that can either read from appview and write into a PDS, but also r/w directly on PDS AFAIU?
	
09:35:45 From Sebastian Vogelsang to Everyone:
	I liked Ruby‚Äôs analogy about runways (PDSs) and the tower (Relay)

	There's also the Raspberry Pi Foundation that do a lot of education stuff for kids around the world. Have wondered about how it would be to use atproto as a basis for local coder dojo project sharing etc.

10:38:52 From Emily Hunt to Everyone:
	being able to verify people on a community-level would be great! this is basically what feeds like the Astro feed or the science feed sorta do by having only a certain list of people be able to post to it, but it'd be lovely if it could show up

	Crypto based, but worth looking at for payments
	
10:39:42 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	Replying to "being able to verify people on a community-level w...":
	Done with labelers, so longer opt in cycle, but verifiers is another path
	
10:39:45 From David Fraser to Everyone:
	Replying to "being able to verify people on a community-level w...":
	Presumably this could be architected like labelers / moderation so that there's a hard-coded verifier but you can also opt in to others?
	
10:39:52 From psingletary.com to Everyone:
	Replying to "being able to verify people on a community-level w...":
	This is possible with deer.social and Trezy and how to setup in ozone
	
10:39:55 From Boris Mann to Everyone:

	Yes, this is how it works
	
10:39:59 From Emily Hunt to Everyone:
	Replying to "being able to verify people on a community-level w...":
	yeah, I think labellers do a good job with this - issue I always hae with them is you have to find them first
	
10:40:13 From David Fraser to Everyone:
	Replying to "being able to verify people on a community-level w...":
	Yes, so a little pressure on BlueSky to allow people to sign up for additional verifiers on their platform :)

	I think for a while payments need to be about piggybacking off of Stripe / FourthWall / Ko-Fi to tie back to a creator, it's just the app view will need to expose that better
	David Fraser, Sebastian Vogelsang:üëçüèº
	
10:46:04 From psingletary.com to Everyone:
