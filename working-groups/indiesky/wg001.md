## Interests

*Pasted in from Luma registration with slight anonymizing. Feel free to claim publicly, add links*

* as part of a vulnerable community, I feel the need to learn more about safe infrastructure and about European tech autonomy. From the product/community side, I am mainly interested in building tools for musicians and (independent) music business.
* EuroSky
* I am interested in running a POC of Community Notes on ATProto. There are many benefits of using independent ATProto architecture, from running PDSs, and indexing to dids. For both projects, e.g Community Notes requires anonymity, and thus, a different PDS architecture, as well as indexing.
* Having services that aren’t tethered to US providers
* Supporting Freeing Our Feeds
* especially interested in anything that helps create greater independence from the Bluesky PBC, for our own project and for the atproto ecosystem as a whole; and specifically, at the moment, we are quite interested in potentially being able to offer independent PDS hosting for our community members.
* academic and researcher focused infrastructure
* Insight into things that are assumed in the bluesky world but may be different if running a separate network (e.g. centralized DIDs and their pros and cons and relationship with privacy)
* data sovereignty
* things like hosting a PDS for our community of scientists would be hugely interesting to us. Having an alt relay to hook in to would also be amazing for us to demonstrate to the wider astronomy community that our platform won't go the way of Twitter someday, and that it can be trusted. ([emily.space](https://bsky.app/profile/emily.space))
* I'm intrigued by AppViewLite and Deer and thinking about how we might leverage them in our next round of infra development (_I think this was me - Æ._)
* Replicating an IPFS pin set across geographically distributed, volunteer-run PDSs
* I work with ActivityPub in museums. I am interested on Fediverse connections.
*  It is my intention to set up a PDS for beyond that of personal use.
*  Able to run couple of PDS. Still looking to setup a relay. More to learn.
*  I might query my PDS for my personal website!
* Communicate opportunities to policymakers. Help build collective intelligence.
* Break Big Tech monopolies
* Interested in how independent publishers and media organizations can have more control over distribution and relationships with fans.
* Im just interested in at protocol dev and want to learn more!
* Hyperlocal digital sovereignty
* Trying to build a fully featured independent AppView, and host an independent Relay.
*  the expectations of lexicon interoperability with existing lexicon.
*  Link attestation of educational skills to a social graph 
* academic institution hosting 
* atproto data storage for "composable" OER
* long-form scientific writing with DOI
* Working on entirely independent bluesky-based social networks, not aiming at federation with the general network, for specific domains (Strava for other domains)

### Interest in running PDS for others
* @icyphox.sh
* @danoleary.me
* @aendra.com
* @erikologic.bsky.social
* @hilk.eu (not sure yet)
* @emily.space

	We 🥰 relays.
	phil, Ian Brown:❤️
	
09:18:10 From Wesley Finck to Everyone:
	Love the shift in framing for governments to support an ecosystem of infrastructure that people can then build sovereign social networks on top of (rather than them trying to build their own social network)
	Emily Hunt:👍
	eduardo, Ian Brown:🥰
	
09:18:24 From Alice to Everyone:
	i run a couple relays in the winter to keep the house warm
	Enrico, phil, Robin Berjon, Ian Brown:😂
	eduardo:🥰
	
09:18:45 From Ted Han to Everyone:
	Ahoy.eu was in Hamburg at the end of April
	
09:19:16 From Ian Brown to Everyone:
	absolutely you need both
	
09:19:32 From Robin Berjon to Everyone:
	considering starting a podcast called Oh Relay?
	Alice, phil:🔥
	Enrico, Shakirov Marat, Ian Brown:😂
	Ted Han:😆
	
09:19:43 From Roscoe Rubin-Rottenberg to Everyone:
	I think the draw for governments will be that they can self host so it’s perfect for official comms channels
	Ian Brown:👌
	
09:21:00 From Ian Brown to Everyone:
	Replying to "I think the draw for governments will be that they...":
	Essential for eg emergency comms
	
09:21:23 From Wesley Finck to Everyone:
	lots of question marks around lexicons for api endpoints (xrpc methods) and pds events - how do you actually implement those and how can you build a relay on top of that?
	
09:21:37 From Emily Hunt to Everyone:
	Replying to "I think the draw for governments will be that they...":
	This! It would be really cool if someday the framework was so easy to do this that governments could set this up without needing much knowledge of the wider infra
	
09:22:19 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	Replying to "lots of question marks around lexicons for api end...":
	Alternate data lexicons are automatically transmitted across the relay right now
	
09:22:40 From Robin Berjon to Everyone:
	Replying to "I think the draw for governments will be that they...":
	We’re not that far from it. I actually had a conversation with institutional folks in Japan in March about verified emergency comms using AT.
	
09:23:01 From Enrico to Everyone:
	Replying to "lots of question marks around lexicons for api end...":
	IDK if it can help but this is one event consumed right at the relay firehose:
	```
	{
	  action: 'create',
	  path: 'app.bsky.feed.like/3looczth7oc2e',
	  cid: 'bafyreich3ih7yhopxsios4iaujhrb6gez3o6uitstluml3cxbyrflnhknq',
	  record: {
	    '$type': 'app.bsky.feed.like',
	    subject: {
	      cid: 'bafyreigpas5h6y2347q6w5mf32hd2nyebo7pz24dyxcf4ygveupii5mtte',
	      uri: 'at://did:plc:k2weqoffrljoi7d45jjhjaqk/app.bsky.feed.post/3loo4uyximc2f'
	    },
	    createdAt: '2025-05-08T16:21:56.395Z'
	  }
	}
	```
	
09:23:29 From Bailey Townsend to Everyone:
	Replying to "lots of question marks around lexicons for api end...":
	For the creating api endpoints, I noticed yesterday in the atproto repo the lex-cli has a gen-server command. Have not tried it yet https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/lex-cli
	
09:24:20 From Rachel-Lee Nabors to Everyone:
	I love how the distributed nature thwarts coordinated attacks like that
	
09:24:26 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	PLC is totally centralized! We should all admit this! The plan of record @Bryan Newbold (Bluesky) is spinning this out into a separate entity — and is high priority as part of the discussion with governments.
	
09:24:40 From Robin Berjon to Everyone:
	Replying to "PLC is totally centralized! We should all admit th...":
	Yesssss
	
09:25:11 From Dan O'Leary to Everyone:
	Can you share a link to that model you're showing now?

	Not Enough Relays
	
09:26:00 From Wesley Finck to Everyone:
	Replying to "lots of question marks around lexicons for api end...":
	Oh cool that gen-server seems relevant…
	
09:26:59 From Nick Gerakines (he/him) to Everyone:
	"something like that" is legit
	Dan O'Leary, James Walker (@walkah), phil, Bailey Townsend, Anirudh:❤️
	
09:27:40 From Enrico to Everyone:
	Sorry, all the other arch diagrams show the PDS as the only client entrypoint. Are we suggesting that the clients can consume directly from AppViews? Or will the PDS still act as a proxy?
	
09:28:08 From Wesley Finck to Everyone:
	Replying to "lots of question marks around lexicons for api end...":
	Ya im mostly thinking about if someone wants to implement custom queries, procedures, and subscriptions (all primary lexicon types) it seems they will need to implement their own pds which provides those endpoints and emits those events. I don’t think there is a way to extend the bsky provided PDS in this way?
	
09:28:47 From Anirudh to Everyone:
	probably helps to mention that the client writes to the PDS
	
09:29:20 From Robin Berjon to Everyone:
	Replying to "lots of question marks around lexicons for api end...":
	You can have your own API endpoint for XRPC (though you don’t have to use XRPC), and that endpoint will write records, blobs, etc. to the PDS.
	
09:30:07 From Robin Berjon to Everyone:
	Can’t wait for UCANs!

09:31:02 From Bailey Townsend to Everyone:
	Replying to "lots of question marks around lexicons for api end...":
	I may be thinking of it wrong. But this is where custom AppViews come in and what I consider them when I talk about them. PDS is source of truth, AppView caches the data and gives you ways to show it. Kind of like the Statusphere where yous have the emojis in the db and then it has an endpoint to show those it picked up from the firehose
	
09:31:40 From Wesley Finck to Everyone:
	Replying to "lots of question marks around lexicons for api end...":
	Hmm, so what’s the point of using lexicons to define endpoints and event types if everyone is just using the ones provided by bsky https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/lexicons/com/atproto/repo
	
09:31:58 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	I think “Login with ATProto” is something we could work on with education / design / messaging
	Bailey Townsend, Laurens Hof:💯
	
09:32:19 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	And then PDS, in some ways, very directly gives data sovereignty — which is explainable
	
09:32:29 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	“Do you want your data hosted in Canada?” -> yes!
	Ian Brown, Emily Hunt:😍
	
09:32:39 From Enrico to Everyone:
	To clarify, my POV is from somebody that would be interested in hosting a full independent clone of BSky so I need to make some considerations in terms of performances and such
	
09:32:39 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	(Without over focusing on the word PDS)

	then it should be standrtized as FIDO or be part of it
	
09:33:24 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	Replying to "To clarify, my POV is from somebody that would be ...":
	Performance is mostly from reads. You’re not going to hit lots of reads without lots of work. See deer.social
	David Fraser:👍🏼

	Rough model of explaining the protocol to non-technical users:

09:33:45 From Boris Mann to Everyone:
	Replying to "Where are the DIDs in this diagram?":
	PLC identifiers
	
09:34:37 From Robin Berjon to Everyone:
	Bluesky can monetise their microblogging service while the AT protocol thrives.
	Ian Brown:👌
	
09:34:43 From Wesley Finck to Everyone:
	Maybe a more accessible analogy: PDS = kind of like a google drive, you have folders and files, but you technically could move it around to dropbox or other providers
	Ian Brown:👌

	And it’s also your browser.
	
09:35:29 From Enrico to Everyone:
	Replying to "To clarify, my POV is from somebody that would be ...":
	Ok so the answer is “it’s app depending”? 
	Atproto allows us to develop an app that can either read from appview and write into a PDS, but also r/w directly on PDS AFAIU?
	
09:35:45 From Sebastian Vogelsang to Everyone:
	I liked Ruby’s analogy about runways (PDSs) and the tower (Relay)

The IETF is nice, but it may be challenging and there are things that it won’t do. We could have a single home for things like a PDS Covenant and the specs — it makes sense to keep tech & governance together. So… we might want to make our own standards org.

	There's also the Raspberry Pi Foundation that do a lot of education stuff for kids around the world. Have wondered about how it would be to use atproto as a basis for local coder dojo project sharing etc.

10:38:52 From Emily Hunt to Everyone:
	being able to verify people on a community-level would be great! this is basically what feeds like the Astro feed or the science feed sorta do by having only a certain list of people be able to post to it, but it'd be lovely if it could show up

	Crypto based, but worth looking at for payments
	
10:39:42 From Boris Mann to Everyone:

	Done with labelers, so longer opt in cycle, but verifiers is another path
	
10:39:45 From David Fraser to Everyone:
	Replying to "being able to verify people on a community-level w...":
	Presumably this could be architected like labelers / moderation so that there's a hard-coded verifier but you can also opt in to others?

	This is possible with deer.social and Trezy and how to setup in ozone
	
10:39:55 From Boris Mann to Everyone:

	Yes, this is how it works
	
10:39:59 From Emily Hunt to Everyone:
	Replying to "being able to verify people on a community-level w...":
	yeah, I think labellers do a good job with this - issue I always hae with them is you have to find them first
	
10:40:13 From David Fraser to Everyone:
	Replying to "being able to verify people on a community-level w...":
	Yes, so a little pressure on BlueSky to allow people to sign up for additional verifiers on their platform :)

	I think for a while payments need to be about piggybacking off of Stripe / FourthWall / Ko-Fi to tie back to a creator, it's just the app view will need to expose that better
	David Fraser, Sebastian Vogelsang:👍🏼
	
10:46:04 From psingletary.com to Everyone:
	crypto payments groups should invest in making an appview and presenting that to appview devs
	
10:46:10 From Laurens Hof to Everyone:
	Majority-world onboarding to atproto happen only with video-first platform anyway, so that would be less of a bsky problem anyway
