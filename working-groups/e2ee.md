# Overview

The E2EE messaging working group is focused on DMs and group chat. The current implementation by Bluesky is out-of-protocol, doesn't support groups (1:1 only), and is not E2EE. The goal is to make an in-protocol and/or protocol-compatible mechanism for group E2EE messaging.

The Messaging Layer Security [MLS](/mls) IETF standard is the preferred standard to build on.
