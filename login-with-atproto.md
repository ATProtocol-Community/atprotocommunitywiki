# Login with ATProto

Starting from [this issue thread](https://github.com/ATProtoApps/community/issues/3), we had a live call today with a number of people sharing design concepts, as well as narrowing down what we want to achieve.

We talked about protocol logos and a bunch of other things, but ultimately scoped this down to "how do we share a base approach for logins that says to users that they can enter an ATProto handle and login".

The ideal outputs would be a symbolm, some help/info text, as well as default HTML/CSS/JS. Developers could drop this into their applications and have some visual and interaction similarity. A call to action to login with ATProto.

Further directions might include a protocol logo (but: git has a protocol logo no one knows, and use Github or Gitlab), some consideration for how OAuth scopes for specific apps look like, or other protocol level design and branding elements.

Please share any imagery in this thread, as well as links to mockups, code, or other elements.
