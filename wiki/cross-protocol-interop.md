# Cross Protocol Interop

Notes and resources for cross-protocol interoperabiltiy 

## Bridges

TODO BridgyFed links

## Groups

ATProto doesn't have limited visibility posting at all. There are several groups implementations on ActivityPub that aren't well supported.

What if we designed a new limited visibility groups design that worked across ATProto and AP (with the assistance of groups aware bridges)

## Long form Article Content

ActivityPub has the Article type, and ATProto will have multiple long form Lexicons that can map to Article.

Work on specifying and adding bridge support, display, and interaction around article content.
