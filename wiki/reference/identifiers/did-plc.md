# DID:PLC
The **Decentralized Identifier method Public Ledger of Credentials (`did:plc`)** is a self-authenticating [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](/en/wiki/reference/identifiers/did) operated by Bluesky Social. It is the most widely used of two currently supported DID methods in the AT Protocol, alongside `did:web`.

Bluesky Social maintains a centralized "[DID PLC Directory](https://web.plc.directory/)", which is used to obtain metadata about and update specific DID PLCs. As of April 2025, the service stores public keys, [handles](/en/wiki/reference/identifiers/handles), and [Personal Data Server (PDS)](/en/wiki/reference/core-architecture/pds) information for any given identifier.
