# PDS Ban List

Right now there are some banned servers (PDS) that are blocked primarily by the Bluesky team. (details?)

As other service providers (see [IndieSky](/working-groups/indiesky)) emerge, how might one share a PDS ban list for collaborative moderation?

Should PDS bans be a type of moderation or other event that gets emitted on the firehose?
