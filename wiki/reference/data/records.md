# Records
**Records** within the AT Protocol are the primary data storage unit within [data repositories](/en/wiki/reference/data/data-repositories). Each record type is defined by a lexicon schema that specifies its structure, required fields, and validation rules. For example, the `app.bsky.feed.post` schema defines the structure of a post on Bluesky, including properties like text content, embedded media, and creation timestamp.
