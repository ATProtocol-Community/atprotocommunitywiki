# AT Protocol Explainers

## General Explainers

> One of the reasons I am enthusiastic about BlueSky is because of the way that it works. So in this post, I am going to lay out some of the design and the principles behind this design, as I understand them. I am not on the BlueSky team, so these are my takes only.

Steve's is one of 5 currently (as of May 1 2025) in this collection: [everything tagged #atprotol and #guide](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=guide&types=like&types=do&types=think&timeframe=anytime&quality=all&tags=atprotocol). I'll add more as I learn more).

## Suggestion
I'd like to work on an explainer which is based around a single diagram, but with multiple levels of detail - eg
* orbital view: shows PDSs, the relay and a couple of appviews
* stratosphere: the PLC Directory becomes visible
...

and so on until we get to a super detailed view of each element in the network. People can start in orbit and drill down as deep as they want to go.

It doesn't have to be artistic - I was thinking maybe a prezi or miro, with multiple frames, each associated with a wiki page which explains the view. I can already see that [Protocol reference](/en/wiki/reference) already sets out the individual elements - it's just a question of creating a user-friendly narrative.
