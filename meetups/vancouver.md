AT Protocol is the standard that powers Bluesky and a growing number of other apps, and regional meetups are spinning up all over the place after the community ATMosphereConf in Seattle.

Join us for the first ATProto Vancouver meetup, hosted by DWebYVR [@dwebyvr.org](https://bsky.app/profile/dwebyvr.org) and Z-Space [@z-space.ca](https://bsky.app/profile/z-space.ca).

We'll share some apps, developer news, and do a show & tell with what people are working on.

No technical skills required! Content creators, community organizers, and everyone else is welcome!

â€‹Jay Graber, CEO of Bluesky, will be speaking at Web Summit Vancouver on Tuesday evening center stage about the [Next Era of Social Media](https://vancouver.websummit.com/sessions/van25/a8089b75-96ca-49b7-98c4-def10e7ad9c4/the-next-era-of-social-media/).

We don't think she'll have time to stick around, but we should definitely gather Bluesky + ATProto fans who are coming to Web Summit!

Tentatively set for lunch time at Z-Space on Wednesday. Sign up and we'll update as plans firm up!
