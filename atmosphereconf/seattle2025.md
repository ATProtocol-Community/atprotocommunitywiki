### What do a Goose, Community Minded Innovators, and Web 2.0 have in common?

> I can hardly remember a time in my life when computers and tech didn’t play a part (It was basically before 1982). With almost 30 years of experience in the Big Tech industry, I have attended many conferences! I can only think of one conference I attended that I didn’t feel totally out of place AND was inspired- Grace Hopper (I got to attend 3 times) UNTIL TODAY.
>
> This weekend I attended the FIRST ATmosphere Developer Conference. Now, I’m not a developer- but the promise of AT Protocol and the growth of Bluesky combined with my next evolution: (soon to be a legal entity) Collective Good Technology A Nonprofit Corporation, I am in full on learning and storming mode.

### s19e08: It’s Not 2006 Anymore; The Useful, Vernacular Institution; What Is Free Our Feeds, Anyway?

> I was at ATMosphere Conference 2025 in Seattle over the weekend. I’ll do some quick scene-setting shorthand so that some people will understand why I’m so excited coming out of it:
>
> It felt like being at an O’Reilly ETech conference in the early 2000s. These were the conferences where web2.0 was invented, solidifed, and named. They were incredibly optimistic times and clearly with the benefit of hindsight, we were stupendously naive and privileged. You just have to look back over the last 18-odd or so years to see how what we thought would happen by default (“more people connected means good things will happen!) totally did not happen and instead ended up reinforcing and making existing power structures worse. Sorry.
> 
> But the energy from those conferences was there over the weekend. It felt like the beginning of something that could make a difference.

### A world without Caesars: How the ATProto community is rebuilding the web to return power to the people

> Don’t call it a Bluesky conference. 
> 
> Over the weekend, the first in-person gathering devoted to those building with the AT Protocol, or ATProto — the technology that powers Bluesky’s growing social network of 33 million-plus users — was held in Seattle. At the event, developers, engineers, founders, and even members of the Bluesky team, including CEO Jay Graber, were in attendance. Many in the community were meeting each other for the first time after having only ever communicated online. 
> 
> But although Bluesky is the largest app built on ATProto at this time, the social network itself was not the ATmosphere Conference’s focus. Here, Bluesky was just another developer — albeit a prominent one, given its stewardship of ATProto, the social networking protocol that offers a framework for building a decentralized social network.

### The under-the-radar tech revolution that could change how the internet works

> There is something meaningful happening under the tech surface and few people are noticing it.
>
> This past weekend, I attended the ATmosphere Conference in Seattle, the first conference about the Authenticated Transfer (AT) Protocol. You likely haven’t heard about it and what it does, but you’ve certainly heard of the social network built using this protocol: Bluesky. (The company’s CEO, Jay Graber, spoke at the conference).
