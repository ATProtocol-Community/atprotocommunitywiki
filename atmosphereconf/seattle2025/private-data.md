## Boris Raw Notes

Goal of private data 
Signal 


MLS

Nostr - 50-75K

Signal 
e2ee
Device 

MLS

Extend to group messaging 

PDS - 

Delivery service 

RCS <> Apple or Google

Group management

Appoint a service?

Can it be observed?

Rabble - traditonal MLS needs a server
P2panda - just letting you set timestamps, and which window 

What if we do something else?

Encrypted records in transmission 

Signal vs 
Germ 

Linking identities that specialize

Should separate keys - not repo signing keys

Can have more than one type of key in PDS

Darius - using other things as sidebands

Bryan 

MEME

Not interop for sure?

Working Group

Zack - Germ, bsky handle - auth bootstrap?
