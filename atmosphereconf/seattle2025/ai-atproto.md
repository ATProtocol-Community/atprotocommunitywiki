> I work on an AI project that’s AT-native, and it’s brought up some interesting ideas about data use and privacy. ATProto is also a promising tool for general AI applications. I’ll do a lightning talk about an interesting application prior to a group discussion, and hopefully it’ll inspire some discussion about where the AT community should place its attention.

We’ll probably discuss the [user intent proposal](https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0008-user-intents) (to opt in / out to different groups wanting to connect with user data), so take a look in advance if you’re planning on participating in the discussion.
